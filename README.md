• Technology category drives the highest profit, while Phones and Chairs lead in sub-category sales.

• Standard Class shipping is the most profitable shipping mode, significantly outperforming other modes.

• Sales have shown a positive upward trend year over year, with a strong increase in 2018.

• West and East regions (can be added if regional data is shown) likely drive the bulk of sales.
